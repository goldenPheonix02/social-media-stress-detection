# Social Media Stress Detection

## Abstract
In this study we explore an innovative method for stress detection and classification by utilizing a combination of machine learning and deep learning techniques. Today, social media can be a goldmine for user behavioural information. Users tend to be more open and outward on their social media posts and this can be used as a key feature in detecting stress. In this project we have studied and implemented various machine learning algorithms, deep neural networks, NLP techniques and pre-trained models like BERT for the detection of stress based on their social media posts and then classifying their stress levels based on their responses to the universally accepted DASS(Depression Anxiety Stress Scales) questionnaire.
